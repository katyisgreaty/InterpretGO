For Future Katy:

-add optional invoice template creator
-link assignments to users in addition to models? Or just link model instances to users?
-OR maybe just add columns to AspNetUser that include Interpreter or Deaf, and other properties, and then get rid
	of those two models?

DONE:

-give authentication user roles
-fix datetime issues
-don't let people make new assignment if they are an interpreter or not signed in (I.e., only let deaf users make a new assignment)
