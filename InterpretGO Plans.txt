To Do in InterpretGO:

-deploy to Azure or firefox from caitlin's suggestion?
-Add page where interpreters can go to see their assignments
-add links from assignments page to deaf user and terp
-link assignments to users in addition to models? Or just link model instances to users?(Or only allow user to see a certain interpreter's assignments if their name and the terp model instance's name match?) 
-OR maybe just add columns to AspNetUser that include Interpreter or Deaf, and other properties, and then get rid of those two models?
-Find other places where the links should only be visible to certain roles
-Link user roles to interpreter and client models (when someone registers as a deaf client, have it also make a model for that, or at least link to making a model)
-Include "accepted" bool change button for terps to accept job
-add "any" option to list of interpreters to choose from
-change assignment "type" to drop down menu
-add functionality for interpreters to see a list of assignments available to anyone (i.e., not already claimed or earmarked for someone specific)
-add email notifications functionality
	-interpreter gets notification when deaf user has requested them for something
	-deaf person gets notification when interpreter has accepted assignment
-add explanation to Home Index page
-style!
-add optional invoice template creator

DONE:

-give authentication user roles
-fix datetime issues
-don't let people make new assignment if they are an interpreter or not signed in (I.e., only let deaf users make a new assignment)
